# Policy files for the Smart Core BOS

TL;DR admins can do anything anywhere, zones are restricted by name, roles restrict permissions.

Test these rules by running `opa test . --v0-compatible` from this directory.

We've split the policies into rules and utilities:

- token.rego contains token related utils like "does the token have this role"
- rpc.rego contains utils for working with requests, for example "is this a write request"

The bulk of the rules are in `smartcore.rego`, which applies these rules to the standard verbs and conventions of Smart
Core apis. Exceptions are encoded into specific rpc rego files.

## Global Data Available to All Policies

The policy package injects some global data into the policy evaluation context. 

### `data.system` - Information about the Smart Core system
- `data.system.known_traits` - A list of fully qualified trait names recognised by BOS. These are prefixes for the
   corresponding gRPC trait APIs. This can be used by the policies to tell which gRPC requests are for trait APIs.
