/**
 * This module exports a mapping between different user roles and their respective permissions
 * in terms of the access levels (full, limited, or blocked) they have to different routes in the application.
 *
 * The route paths are represented as regex patterns to facilitate matching against absolute route paths.
 *
 * Each role object contains three properties:
 * - fullAccess: an array of routes that the role has full access to.
 * - limitedAccess: an array of routes that the role has limited access to.
 * - blockedAccess: an array of routes that the role has no access to.
 *
 * The roles defined are as follows:
 * - admin: Has the highest level of access with full access to all of the routes and no blocked routes.
 * - superAdmin: Similar to the admin but tailored for supervisory roles, with extensive full access routes.
 * - commissioner: A role with considerable access but restricted from accessing authentication-related routes.
 * - operator: A role with a mixture of full and limited access to various routes, ideal for operation-related tasks.
 * - signage: Primarily has access to signage related routes, with all other routes being blocked.
 * - viewer: A role with full access to viewing signage and limited access to all other routes.
 *
 * @type {Object<string, {fullAccess: string[], limitedAccess: string[], blockedAccess: string[]}>}
