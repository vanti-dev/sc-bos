# User management

These pages are a copy of the accounts pages but with functionality limited to users only.
They are temporary, and exist only while we are migrating our permission system to the new one.

These pages allow people to manage users that were previously only settable via the users.json file on disk.

UsersPage.vue is a modified copy of ../accounts/AccountsPage.vue.
UsersSideBar.vue is a modified copy of ../accounts/AccountsSideBar.vue.
The components used by these page components are all in the accounts directory, with options for users only.
